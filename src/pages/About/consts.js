            That's enough talking about me in the third person....

            I'm just someone who falls off of colorful rocks at my bouldering gym,
            plays DND with my friends, messes around with craft projects,
            and designs silly tools my friends use for their games!

            My interests in creating things bounces from new development frameworks to polymer clay in the span of weeks,
            and my site reflects my wide array of experiments and interests. Sorry for the chaos :D
