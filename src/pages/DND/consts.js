            At the bottom of this page you can find printer-friendly, DND sheets for 5E, that I've
            hand-designed using Figma and Goodnotes.

            Feel free to print them out for physical use, or copy them over to
            your favorite tablet notebook app to begin scribbling!

            While I had been very happy with a handful of custom
            sheets I had found on Dungeon Masters Guild and other small businesses over the last few years,
            I eventually realized that I was hacking around them to accommodate my needs,
            whether it be scribbling campaign notes in the margins, grabbing additional sheets of paper to begin to keep track
            of NPCS, quests, or party health, or just not writing anything down, and instead keeping the relevant books and
            google tabs open on my laptop to reference mid-game.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chaos of trying to figure out what I could or couldn't do with my character resulted in me spending less time
            paying attention to the game and more time reading chicken scratch and digging through books.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal with these sheets is that I hope they can allow more people to engage with their game, as most everything that is
            needed can be easily found and referenced within a few page flips.
        </p>
