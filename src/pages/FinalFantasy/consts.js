            Final Fantasy 14 Auto Crafter is a simplistic script that assists in the mass crafting of in-game items, primarily food and potions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The primary use case is for crafters looking to sell potions/foods
            on the in-game market board, and/or raiders needing to maintain a large stock
            of potions/foods for raiding.
        </p>

            While not a high end raider myself, I had many friends who regularly participated in it
            within FFXIV. In our discord, it wasnâ€™t unusual for to see them panicking last minute
            about gathering enough supplies to craft potions, or complaining about the elevated
            marketboard prices for potions that week.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hilariously, my experience with writing selenium webdriver tests at one of my jobs
            meant that I had some familiarity with basic point and click bots at the time, and so
            I threw together a rough script.
        </p>

        <p>
            It allowed me to run my game overnight and craft enough potions at a much lower cost
            than buying them directly from the marketboard, and freed up a large amount of time
            previously spent manually crafting.
