            Pokemon Type Chart is a type matchup chart suitable for Pokemon Generations
            VI and forward. It was designed in response to the canon type matchup charts
            released by the Pokémon company, specifically focusing on addressing their
            readability.

            While I have been playing the Pokémon games for years at this point,
           I had a resurgence in interest with Pokemon Go, Pokemon Legends of Arceus,
           and Pokémon Scarlet/Violet in 2022. I hadn’t taken much interest in the type
           charts when I was much younger, however, as my friends and I tried out the
           competitive scene, we struggled to parse the existing type charts released
           by the Pokemon company.

            I designed this chart to follow the way I, and by extension my friends,
            thought about our actions in the game. For example, we would consider the
            type of the moves we were using, and then think about its effectiveness
            against the enemy Pokemon type.

            The existing charts, while very minimalistic, required an understanding of
            the iconography used that would be difficult to remember given enough time
            away from the game. As our interests in the games fluctuated from year to
            year, I found the more text heavy, and dense type chart easier to parse.
